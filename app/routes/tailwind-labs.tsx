                            You might say the crossover of roman-bytes (me) and
                            Tailwind. My name is Jacob Roman also known as
                            roman-bytes. I have been working in the web industry
                            for just over 10 years now, I started out as a
                            designer and was learning code everyday. I learned a
                            ton about Wordpress as that was the most commonly
                            used CMS at the time. I then switched gears to
                            learning Javascript, eventually React, and
                            everything else that goes along with that ecosystem.
                            I currently work at Launch by NTT Data and am
                            looking for some new challenges. I am currently
                            leading a team that is focused on growing and become
                            a full stack team, we are focused in the payment
                            area of an enterprise company that is well known for
                            video games. We currently take care of the client
                            work which is done in NextJS, GraphQL, SCSS, and
                            GraphQL. I would like something that is more of a
                            creative roll and still involved with coding on a
                            day to day. I can not express how excited I am that
                            I have the chance to apply for this position. Below
                            you will find multiple examples and reasons why I
                            would be a good fit for this role.

                            It always seems like there is never enough time to
                            work on side projects or projects that I am
                            passionate about. Having two kids under the age of 7
                            might have something to do with that. Now that we
                            are past the potty training stage as a parent, I
                            feel like I will have more time to spend on actually
                            creating more of these side projects.

                            This is my most current project that I am working on
                            since the NHL Playoffs will be starting soon. I have
                            tried to start this project in the past but never
                            started soon enough, to be prepared for the playoff
                            season. I wanted to start this project because the
                            default NHL playoff bracket is:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="ml-4 list-item mb-10">
                            <li>1. Always hard to find.</li>
                            <li>2. Brackets all looked the same and boring.</li>
                            <li>
                                3. Games for the current day where annoying to
                                find.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            A few features I plan to add to this bracket that I
                            normally do not see on other brackets is
                            interactivity. This will be synced with the live
                            game APIs that exist today and I plan to make the
                            bracket more interactive and clear that a game was
                            going on. I also plan to make this bracket more
                            round focused, brackets typically are static and
                            keep the bracket layout. I want to push this further
                            with animations, as you can sort of see from the
                            linked figma design. Each round is going to be
                            brought forward and in focus, to go even further
                            with that idea. I plan on having much more stats
                            showing when a game is live, and links to the live
                            broadcast.

                        <p className="mb-6">
                            Next up, Bloctics. This one I am very excited about
                            but as I have learned will take me some time.
                            Growing up I played a game called Tactics Arena with
                            one of my best friends. Its basically a chess like
                            game but your pieces come to life, for example you
                            had a knight that would move in any direction for 4
                            tiles and only attacked in any direction for one
                            square. But an archer could move 5 tiles in all
                            directions and attack in all directions for 8 tiles.
                            This game has come and gone, and died out, was built
                            in flash and I have always wanted to find a way to
                            move it to mobile. So I just started from what I
                            knew best, HTML, JS, and CSS. The projects current
                            state is everything you are seeing is running in
                            HTML, CSS, and JS. I am using xState for the game
                            state and Remix as the framework, I plan on adding
                            multiplayer and a lobby type system. Not 100% sure
                            how that will work currently but did plan on taking
                            a peek at PartyKit as I have heard lots of good
                            things about that library.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            As mentioned I used xState to help keep track of
                            game state. You can view the machines below if you
                            are interested in seeing how the machines work
                            together. Below that you can find some screenshots
                            of the actual game, I do not have designs for this
                            as I wanted to see if something like this was even
                            possible to do. If I pick this project back up I
                            plan on designing and fine tuning the UI, I also
                            plan on having animated attacks and walking.

                            Fusilier Family Farms has a special place in my
                            heart, this is a close friends family business and
                            they had been running a yearly thing where you could
                            order farm fresh produce to your door. It was
                            getting out of hand with some things they were
                            doing, so they reached out for some help. We had
                            meetings and narrowed down what they wanted and
                            needed to make sure that things run smoother for
                            them. The project broke down because I just did not
                            have the bandwith to work on such a project. They
                            found a local business that specialized in this type
                            of thing and it seems like they got things up and
                            running. Regardless I got to do a lot of work for
                            them and am glad I had that experience. I really
                            hope to see this come alive some day.

                            dashboard, they wanted to have some custom features
                            and dealing with farm produce is always all over the
                            place. I landed on Medusa to handle this and it is a
                            great open source option to get a store up and
                            running. I designed and built out the dashboard with
                            the custom features in mind.

                            This opportunity is something that I am very excited
                            about, ever since I realized that stuff you design
                            for the web can be created. I have always had a
                            passion for building things on the web, I figured it
                            was a good idea to finish out my college degree with
                            the focus in Graphic Design and then learning coding
                            on my own. It was an age where the web was brand new
                            and everyone started using it, so I figured it was
                            the right move for me. The position of Design
                            Engineer seems like the perfect fit for me, I have
                            experience of designing all sorts of different
                            digital things. I also have the ability to figure
                            things out when it comes to coding. Reading through
                            the list of things that this position will be
                            responsible for has me very excited.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            One of the things I would be most excited to work on
                            would be the color pallete tool. Having a background
                            in design and working at a web accesibility company
                            for a few years. I feel confident that this is
                            something that I could make work really well,
                            especially if we have accesibility approved colors
                            built in. Secondly, being able to create new
                            templates is something that I have always wanted the
                            chance to do, both the micro-sites and creating or
                            updating existing tailwind templates would be
                            something that I would enjoy.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb=6">
                            Lastly, I would enjoy working on any one of the
                            small utils/tools that would help improve tailwind
                            labs developer performance. Interal tools are always
                            useful and can be a big benefit to increase speed
                            and productivity. Solving issues by creating an
                            internal tool or researching a way to support a
                            certain feature in the future is something that I
                            always like digging into and learning more about.

                            Managing your gear in that game was fairly annoying,
                            so a few developers from the community started
                            working on an app called DIM (Destiny Item Manager).
                            I adventually re-designed and created an updated
                            micro-site so that it was inline with the current
                            theme and feel of Destiny.{' '}

                            release some day is a multi-chat application for
                            streamers. Last year, the well known streaming
                            platform Twitch allowed you to stream on multiple
                            platforms, streamers now have an issue where they
                            have to have 2-4 chat windows open. This project
                            would be open source for anyone to contribute too or
                            just use. It would be a place where you can punch in
                            your username and everything would just work. You
                            would be able to see chats from all the different
                            platforms that you have enabled or are currently
                            live on. It is very very early stages but can be{' '}

                            If there is anything I have learned over the years
                            from being a developer and mentoring other
                            developers along the way. It is that everyone learns
                            and retains things differently, I learned this
                            recently when I was going over product requirements
                            with a fellow QA teammate. There was a prodcut
                            requirements document that was shared with us all
                            but this teammate was having some problems getting a
                            full grasp of what was changing. They needed to
                            really understand so they could know what to test
                            and how to test for this new feature. Finally, I
                            relized that I needed some extra help explaining the
                            feature and what was getting touch/updated. I broken
                            out MS paint and drew a diagram to explain the parts
                            that were getting updated and what needed to be
                            tested. This helped give a better picture of what
                            needed to be done on that teammates end.

                            Another experience that I can call out is that
                            Fusilier Family Farms project, creating all this new
                            stuff for them I wanted to make sure they understood
                            what was going on and what was expected. In figma, I
                            took the time to create a high level diagram of the
                            moving pieces and what was needed for what they
                            wanted. They asked plenty of questions not really
                            knowing much about the web and how it all worked but
                            they did really seem to catch on fairly quickly with
                            how things worked and why we needed them. You can
                            find that diagram below.
