                            You might say the crossover of roman-bytes (me) and
                            Tailwind. My name is Jacob Roman also known as
                            roman-bytes. I have been working in the web industry
                            for over a decade now. I started out as a designer
                            and was challenging myself with learning new code
                            everyday. I immersed myself in the world of
                            Wordpress; as that was the most commonly used CMS at
                            the time. I then switched gears to learning
                            Javascript, eventually React, and everything else
                            that goes along with that ecosystem. I currently
                            work at Launch by NTT Data and in search of fresh,
                            exciting new challenges. Day-to-day I lead a team
                            that is focused on growing and becoming a full stack
                            team. We are focused in the payment area of an
                            enterprise company that is well known for video
                            games. We currently take care of the client work
                            which is done in NextJS, GraphQL, SCSS, and GraphQL.
                            I am looking for a positiong which melds my two
                            passions together: being creative with design and
                            also using code daily. I can not express how excited
                            I am that I have the chance to apply for this
                            position. Below you will find multiple examples and
                            reasons why I would be an ideal candidate for this
                            role and an asset to the team.

                            This is my most current project since the NHL
                            Playoffs will be starting soon. Since I enjoy
                            watching hockey, especially during playoff time, I
                            always have a bracket open on my computer. I wanted
                            to challenge myself to create a bracket in code and
                            then take it a step further to create new features
                            that were not only interactive but more useful than
                            what was already out there. Some of the reasons I
                            started this project is because:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="ml-4 list-item mb-10">
                            <li>
                                1. The Playoff Bracket is always hard to find.
                            </li>
                            <li>2. Brackets all looked the same.</li>
                            <li>
                                3. Games for the current day were tedious to
                                find.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            A few features I plan to add to this bracket that I
                            normally do not see on other brackets is
                            interactivity. This will be synced with the live
                            game APIs that exist today and I plan to make the
                            bracket more interactive and clear that a game was
                            going on. I also plan to make this bracket more
                            round focused, brackets typically are static and
                            keep the bracket layout. I want to push this further
                            with animations, as you can sort of see from the
                            linked figma design. Each round is going to be
                            brought forward and in focus, to go even further
                            with that idea. I plan on having statistics showing
                            when a game is live, as well as links to the live
                            broadcast.

                            Next up, Bloctics. This one I am very excited about
                            but as I have learned will take me some time.
                            Growing up I played a game called Tactics Arena with
                            one of my best friends. It's basically a chess like
                            game but your pieces come to life. For example, you
                            had a knight that would move in any direction for 4
                            tiles and only attacked in any direction for 1 tile.
                            But an archer could move 5 tiles in all directions
                            and attack in all directions for 8 tiles. This game
                            has come and gone, and was built in Flash and I have
                            always wanted to find a way to move it to mobile. I
                            decided to start from what I knew best, HTML, JS,
                            and CSS. I am using xState for the game state and
                            Remix as the framework. I plan on adding multiplayer
                            and a lobby type system. My next plan of action is
                            to investigate PartyKit, as I have heard great
                            things about that library.
                        </p>
                        <p className="mb-6">
                            As previously mentioned, I used xState to help keep
                            track of game state. You can view the machines below
                            if you are interested in seeing how the machines
                            work together. Below that you can view screenshots
                            of the actual game, I do not have designs for this
                            as I wanted to see if something like this was even
                            possible to do. If I pick this project back up I

                            Fusilier Family Farms has a special place in my
                            heart, this is a close friend's family business.
                            They had a subscription model where you could order
                            farm fresh produce to your door. It was becoming
                            unmanageable, so they reached out for some help. We
                            met a few times to identify what they most needed
                            help with. I began this process for them and then
                            they transferred to a local business with more
                            bandwidth. It was a great learning experience.

                            dashboard, they wanted to have custom features for
                            specifically dealing with the challenges of fresh
                            produce. I landed on Medusa to handle this and it is
                            a great open source option to get a store up and
                            running. I designed and built out the dashboard with
                            the custom features in mind.

                            This opportunity is something I am very excited
                            about. I remember the time when I first realized I
                            could code and create the designs I made. I have
                            always had a passion for building things on the web,
                            and while I know there are college programs for
                            that, I was close to finishing my bachelor's degree
                            in graphic design. After school I wholeheartedly
                            pursued learning code and am completley self-taught.
                            The position of Design Engineer is the perfect fit
                            for me, I have experience designing all sorts of
                            different digital UI's- everything from logos to
                            micro-sites to web applications. Due to my passion
                            for code and being self-taught I have an uncanny
                            ability to figure anything out when it comes to
                            code. I will not stop until a solution is reached.
                            Reading through the list of responsibilities for
                            this position has lit a fire in me and has me very
                            excited.

                            One of the projects I would be most excited to work
                            on would be the color pallete tool. Having a
                            background in design and working at a web
                            accessibility company for years I feel confident
                            this is something that I could make work really
                            well, especially if we have accessibility approved
                            colors built in. In addition, being able to create
                            new templates is something that I have always wanted
                            the chance to do, both the micro-sites and creating
                            or updating existing tailwind templates would be
                            something I would greatly enjoy.

                            Lastly, I would enjoy working on any one of the
                            small utils/tools that would help improve tailwind
                            labs developer performance. Internal tools are
                            always useful and can be a huge asset to increase
                            speed and productivity. Solving issues by creating
                            an internal tool or researching a way to support a
                            certain feature in the future is something that I
                            always like digging into and learning more about.

                            application for streamers. Last year, the well-known
                            streaming platform Twitch allowed you to stream on
                            multiple platforms, streamers now have an issue
                            where they have to have 2-4 chat windows open. This
                            project will be open source for anyone to contribute
                            to or just use. This app will allow you to add your

                            If there is anything I have learned over the years
                            from being a developer and mentoring other
                            developers along the way, it is that everyone learns
                            and retains things differently. I learned this
                            recently when I was going over product requirements
                            with a fellow QA teammate. There was a prodcut
                            requirements document that was shared with us all
                            but this teammate was having some problems getting a
                            full grasp of what was changing. They needed to
                            really understand so they could know what to test
                            and how to test for this new feature. Finally, I
                            realized that I needed some extra help explaining
                            the feature and what was getting touch/updated. I
                            opened up MS paint and drew a diagram to explain the
                            parts that were getting updated and what needed to
                            be tested. This helped give a better picture of what
                            needed to be done on that teammate's end.

                            Another teaching experience I recall is the Fusilier
                            Family Farms project, creating all the updated
                            digital footprint for them I needed to explain the
                            changes to them in a way that was clearly
                            understood. In figma, I took the time to create a
                            high level diagram of the moving pieces and what was
                            needed for what they wanted. They asked plenty of
                            questions not really knowing much about the web and
                            how it all worked but they caught on fairly quickly
                            with how things worked and why we needed them. You
                            can find that diagram below.
